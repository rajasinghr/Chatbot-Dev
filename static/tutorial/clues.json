      "clue": "The 5 different project members are: (1) Tina, (2) the one in Seattle, (3) the Systems Analyst, (4) the one with the most project hours, and (5) the one with the fewest project hours.",
      "explanation": "When all of the available information was crossreferenced, it was determined that the 5 members identified here by name/role/office/hours have incompatible requirements and thus, are mutually exclusive."
    },
    "2": {
      "clue": "Rachel should be assigned exactly twice as many hours as the person assigned to the Los Angeles office (who should not be Tina). The person working from Los Angeles should be assigned more hours than the Database Administrator.",
      "explanation": "Reminder: Project members must be provided enough hours to work as full-time employees while avoiding overtime pay. Analyses of hourly requirements have determined that the number of hours assigned to Rachel, the Los Angeles office, and the Database Administrator must be different amounts. The exact amount of hours could not be identified, but their relative order (from greater to fewer hours) could be determined and has been described above. Additionally, Tina has specifically requested not to be assigned to the Los Angeles office"
    },
    "3": {
      "clue": "Leon needs to be assigned exactly half as many hours as the Chicago office.",
      "explanation": "Reminder: Each branch must maximize profits by having as many project hours as possible while minimizing expensive overtime wages. The data indicates that Leon is close to reaching overtime wages while the Chicago office is falling quite short of the company's minimum requirement for project hours. Thus, in order to maximize profit and reduce overtime pay, it has been determined that Leon should receive exactly half the number of hours that the Chicago office will receive."
    },
    "4": {
      "clue": "The Boston office needs more project hours per week than what is required of the Cybersecurity Specialist role.",
      "explanation": "Current estimates predict that the Cybersecurity Specialist's tasks will be fewer than what is needed for the Boston office. Thus, if the Boston office is assigned the Cybersecurity Specialist, it will not be able to meet the company's miniumum requirement of project hours"
    },
    "5": {
      "clue": "Alex needs more hours than the Network Architect role provides.",
      "explanation": "Reminder: Project members must meet the minimum weekly requirement to qualify as full-time employees. Alex requires more project hours to meet the company's minimum weekly requirement for a full-time employee. However, the Network Architect's role does not provide enough hours to meet Alex's needs."
    }

  "redundant": {
    "1": {
      "clue": "Tina should not be assigned to work in Seattle.",
      "explanation": "Tina has no friends or family near Seattle and is likely to feel unhappy if she needs to move far away from them."
    },
    "2": {
      "clue": "Tina should not be the Systems Analyst.",
      "explanation": "Tina does not have the experience nor the personal interest in a Systems Analyst's tasks."
    },
    "3": {
      "clue": "Tina should not be assigned 4 or 12 hours to work on the project.",
      "explanation": "All employees must meet a minimum number of billable hours per week. However, all employees receive 1.5X their normal pay for any overtime work. 4 hours will not be enough for Tina to meet the minimum weekly requirement, but assigning 12 hours will require expensive overtime pay."
    },
    "4": {
      "clue": "The Systems Analyst should not be assigned to the Seattle office.",
      "explanation": "There are not enough skilled assistants at the Seattle branch that can help the System Analyst complete key tasks on time. It will be more efficient if the System Analyst works out of a different office"
    },
    "5": {
      "clue": "The Systems Analyst should not be assigned 4 or 12 hours on the project.",
      "explanation": "The System Analyst's tasks will most likely require more than 4 hours per week. However, 12 hours per week may be excessive and require expensive overtime pay."
    },
    "6": {
      "clue": "Seattle should not be budgeted for either 4 or 12 hours.",
      "explanation": "Due to corporate policies, each office must meet a certain number of project hours per week. The Seattle office needs more than 4 hours to meet the company's minimum requirements. However, if the Seattle branch is assigned 12 hours, several support staff will require overtime pay and cause the office to exceed their budget."
    },
    "7": {
      "clue": "Rachel should not be assigned to work in Los Angeles.",
      "explanation": "Rachel requires more hours than the Los Angeles office. If Rachel is transferred to Los Angeles, it will be difficult for the office to meet the company's requirements and to stay within the project's budget."
    },
    "8": {
      "clue": "Tina should not be assigned to the Los Angeles office.",
      "explanation": "Tina has filed several complaints against an employee at the Los Angeles office and expressed a preference not to work there. There is likely to be conflict if she is transferred to the Los Angeles office."
    },
    "9": {
      "clue": "Rachel should not be the Database Administrator.",
      "explanation": "Rachel requires more hours than the Database Administrator's role provides. If Rachel is assigned as the Database Administrator, she will not be abe to work enough hours and it will be difficult to complete all of the Database Administrator's tasks on time"
    },
    "10": {
      "clue": "The Database Administrator should not be assigned to the Los Angeles office.",
      "explanation": "The Los Angeles office requires more hours than what is needed for the Database Administrator. If the Database Administrator is assigned to the Los Angeles office, it will be difficult to meet the company's requirements and stay within the project's budget."
    },
    "11": {
      "clue": "Rachel will require either 8 or 12 hours on the project.",
      "explanation": "It was previously determined that Rachel needs exactly twice as many hours as the Los Angeles office. Since the only assignments which are exactly twice any other amount are 8 and 12 hours, these are the only possible assignments for Rachel"
    },
    "12": {
      "clue": "The Los Angeles office will require more than 4 hours but fewer than 12 hours.",
      "explanation": "The Los Angeles office needs fewer hours than Rachel, but more hours than the Database Administrator. It has been previously determined that assigning 12 hours to the Los Angeles branch will require staff to be paid overtime, while 4 hours will not be enough to reach the minimum. Thus, the ideal number of hours for the Los Angeles office must be within this range."
    },
    "13": {
      "clue": "The Database Administrator should be assigned fewer than 10 project hours.",
      "explanation": "Since the Database Adminstrator must have fewer hours than both Rachel and the Los Angeles office, that role cannot be assigned 12 nor 10 hours; doing so would not allow both Rachel and the Los Angeles office to be assigned more hours than the Database Administrator."
    },
    "14": {
      "clue": "Leon cannot be assigned to the Chicago office.",
      "explanation": "Leon needs fewer hours than the Chicago office. If Leon is assigned to the Chicago office, it will be difficult for that branch to meet the company's requirements and stay within the project's budget."
    },
    "15": {
      "clue": "Leon should be assigned either 4 or 6 hours.",
      "explanation": "If Leon is assigned more than 6 hours, his overtime wages may cause the project budget to be exceeded."
    },
    "16": {
      "clue": "The Chicago office will require either 8 or 12 hours.",
      "explanation": "It was previously determined that the Chicago office needs twice as many hours as Leon. Since the only assignments which are exactly twice any other amount are 8 and 12 hours, these are the only possible assignments for the Chicago office."
    },
    "17": {
      "clue": "The Cybersecurity Specialist should not be assigned to Boston.",
      "explanation": "The Cybersecurity Specialist role needs fewer hours than the Boston office. If the Cybersecurity Specialist is assigned to the Boston office, it will be difficult for that branch to meet the company's requirements and stay within the project's budget."
    },
    "18": {
      "clue": "The Cybersecurity Specialist should not be assigned 12 hours per week.",
      "explanation": "The Cybersecurity Specialist's tasks are not projected to require the greatest number of project hours. If the Cybersecurity Specialist role is given 12 hours, there will not be enough time remaining for the other important tasks to be completed."
    },
    "19": {
      "clue": "The Boston office should not be assigned 4 hours.",
      "explanation": "Each office must meet the weekly minimum number of hours set by corporate. 4 hours is not enough for the Boston office to meet this requirement."
    },
    "20": {
      "clue": "Alex should not be the Network Architect.",
      "explanation": "The Network Architect role will provide too little work for Alex to meet the minimum weekly requirements."
    },
    "21": {
      "clue": "Alex should be assigned more than 4 hours.",
      "explanation": "Since Alex requires a greater number of project hours than the Network Architect, Alex cannot be assigned the fewest number of hours."
    },
    "22": {
      "clue": "The Network Architect should not be assigned 12 hours.",
      "explanation": "Since the Network Architect role does not require more hours than Alex, the Network Architect should not be assigned the maximum number of hours."
